CHANGES FROM 2.6.0-beta1 to 2.6.0-beta2
---------------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.6.0-beta2>)

   As well as bugfixes, beta2 brings a substantial revision of the Europe
   WWI scenario, the "sandbox" ruleset showing off new engine features,
   and a number of UI improvements in the Qt client.

Server / General

Changes affecting players (supplied rulesets)

     * Savegames created from scenarios could fail to save map resources.
       HRM#697666
     * Client/server communication could fail when the client discovered a
       tile with a text label that was too long. (This could be
       locale-dependent; it showed up in the Russian localization.)
       HRM#720199
     * Fixed server crashes caused by AI ferry passengers dying.
       HRM#721949 HRM#714453
     * The cost to buy "small wonders" (such as the Palace) was
       unintentionally twice what was intended. (This was a longstanding
       issue.) HRM#706727
     * Capturing a unit did not count for cancelling the capturer's
       fortified status, nor for unitwaittime. HRM#692282
     * The 'sandbox' ruleset from Git is now included. This is a place for
       developers to experiment with and demonstrate new engine features,
       without regard to game balance or savefile compatibility; sandbox
       games started in this version may not load into future releases
       (even minor 2.6.x releases). HRM#696004
     * The "Europe 1901" scenario has been replaced with a newer version
       (and is now called "Europe 1900 WWI"). The changes are described on
       the forum. HRM#697660 HRM#696031 HRM#724926
     * Some updates to the "large Earth" scenario. Notably, players now
       start with their first city built. HRM#702265
     * The tutorial scenario's message about city growth to size 13
       referenced a nonexistent event type. Possibly this was causing "lua
       error" messages. HRM#723052
     * When loading a savegame from 2.5 or before, the set of victory
       conditions was not preserved. HRM#698566
     * Fix an assertion failure when auto-arranging city workers in tricky
       situations (while trying to invoke last-ditch measures). HRM#695022
     * Minor nation tweaks. HRM#697681 HRM#697682 HRM#706252 HRM#707576
       HRM#707595

Changes affecting other rulesets / modders

     * The city_size_change Lua signal is now emitted after the size
       change in all cases, is no longer emitted when city growth turned
       out to be prevented, and can cope with the signal handler
       destroying the city. HRM#690756 HRM#700910 HRM#701045
     * The values of Lua variables could fail to be loaded from savegames,
       if some of the saved variables referenced game objects (units,
       cities, etc). In some cases this was locale-dependent. HRM#722287
       HRM#722288

General

     * Sped up shared vision transfers; this helps particularly when
       loading savegames. HRM#723442
     * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
       HRM#699017 HRM#695946 HRM#705553 HRM#701840 HRM#700909 HRM#702406
       HRM#702806 HRM#705391 HRM#705525 HRM#705468 HRM#718497

AI

     * The AI now values science more than gold. HRM#662670
     * The AI is now more motivated to try for a space race victory.
       HRM#660489
     * The threaded AI's worker units could build fruitless roads.
       HRM#706211
     * Fix autosettler bugs:
          + Autosettlers were not acting on their desire to build road
            networks and prevent climate change. HRM#719516
          + Autosettlers didn't get around to doing activities of marginal
            benefit, even if they had nothing better to do. HRM#719512
          + Autosettlers were overvaluing roads on hex maps, and built
            them in odd patterns for no good reason. HRM#695738

Clients

     * The "Turn Done" button is now disabled in fixed-length gameplay,
       since it serves no purpose. HRM#700675
     * Messages from the server operator (/wall) now default to causing a
       pop-up dialog, for new client installations. (Such messages can be
       used for instance to warn of server shutdown; without this setting,
       it was not possible to see the message after the server
       disconnected.) HRM#690212
     * Trying to load a savegame from a ruleset with a preferred_tileset
       (such as the 'civ2civ3_earth' modpack) using the -f command-line
       option caused error messages and a quit HRM#706353; in the Qt
       client, the same would happen with the savegame dialog. HRM#706356
       HRM#709134
     * Bugfixes to the Gtk3.x clients:
          + The Windows build crashed when browsing for savegames.
            HRM#701751 HRM#701889
          + When zoomed out, unused parts of the map view could fail to
            have a black background. HRM#638737
          + The minimap didn't update often enough. HRM#697658
          + Trouble and console warnings with middle-click popups,
            tooltips, etc. HRM#699488 HRM#703869
          + Less laggy animations in the Gtk3.22 client. We hope to bring
            this to the Gtk3 client too. HRM#696457 HRM#700642 HRM#704182
            HRM#706322 HRM#707623 HRM#700641
     * Bugfixes and other changes to the Qt client:
          + It was not possible to select spaceship parts to build in
            cities. HRM#709338
          + The client could segfault after displaying an early error
            message (such as a tileset loading error). HRM#704711
          + Changing research unintentionally closed the research dialog.
            HRM#708554
          + Keyboard shortcuts for the city dialog: left/right will change
            cities, up/down will change production of the current city.
            HRM#709335
          + Diplomatic treaties can be accepted or rejected with the
            keyboard. HRM#709337
          + Double-clicking on a server name will now connect to it.
            HRM#704602
          + The city worklist tooltip now shows more information.
            HRM#704607
          + Themes can now affect dialogs' title bars. HRM#710896
          + Other cosmetic tweaks. HRM#704608 HRM#704929 HRM#708258

Tilesets / Art

     * Tweak the position of the patrol icon in the Hexemplio/Toonhex
       tilesets. HRM#686635

       HRM#697680 HRM#698845 HRM#700291 HRM#699161
     * Miscellaneous changes to developer/ruleset docs. HRM#700290
       HRM#705526
     * Invisible changes to assist localization. HRM#657416 HRM#698844

Translations

     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: French.
          + Incomplete translations: Finnish (100% core, 91% nations, 100%
            ruledit), Polish (>99.9% core, 100% nations, 100% ruledit),

            97.4% nations, 18% ruledit).

Build/portability

     * Do not insist on a 'tolua' command; it is not needed when building
       from a tarball. HRM#675964
